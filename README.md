# Business-Case-Walmart---Confidence-Interval-and-CLT-

**About Walmart**
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

**Business Problem**
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customer’s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

**Dataset**
The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:

User_ID:	User ID

Product_ID:	Product ID

Gender:	Sex of User

Age:	Age in bins

Occupation:	Occupation(Masked)

City_Category:	Category of the City (A,B,C)

StayInCurrentCityYears:	Number of years stay in current city

Marital_Status:	Marital Status

ProductCategory:	Product Category (Masked)

Purchase:	Purchase Amount

**What good looks like?**
1.	Import the dataset and do usual data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.
2.	Detect Null values & Outliers (using boxplot, “describe” method by checking the difference between mean and median, isnull etc.)
3.	Do some data exploration steps like:
o	Tracking the amount spent per transaction of all the 50 million female customers, and all the 50 million male customers, calculate the average, and conclude the results.
o	Inference after computing the average female and male expenses.
o	Use the sample average to find out an interval within which the population average will lie. Using the sample of female customers you will calculate the interval within which the average spending of 50 million male and female customers may lie.
4.	Use the Central limit theorem to compute the interval. Change the sample size to observe the distribution of the mean of the expenses by female and male customers.
o	The interval that you calculated is called Confidence Interval. The width of the interval is mostly decided by the business: Typically 90%, 95%, or 99%. Play around with the width parameter and report the observations.
5.	Conclude the results and check if the confidence intervals of average male and female spends are overlapping or not overlapping. How can Walmart leverage this conclusion to make changes or improvements?
6.	Perform the same activity for Married vs Unmarried and Age
o	For Age, you can try bins based on life stages: 0-17, 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51+ years.
7.	Give recommendations and action items to Walmart.
